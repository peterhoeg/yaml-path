* yaml-path

Shows you your location in a YAML file in Emacs using =eldoc= and/or
=which-function-mode=.

A friendly fork whose primary purpose in life is to make YAML editing in emacs
slightly better and eventually become part of upstream =yaml-path=.

This fork does not want to live alone!

Changes from upstream:

1. Enable autoloading
2. Support =eldoc=
3. Support =which-function-mode=
