## yaml-path.el
*Display the path of the current YAML element.  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-*

---

This provides a function to display an xpath-like string
for the yaml element on the current line.
It's meant to complement Yoshiki Kurihara's yaml-mode.el.

It doesn't strictly depend on yaml-mode, but works better
with yaml-mode.  (That's because yaml-mode makes syntax-ppss usable
for locating comments.)

The only function you should need is yaml-path/path.
It's convenient to bind that to a key, e.g. C-c C-p.
(Instructions for doing that only in yaml-mode are below.)

### Installation


To install, just drop this file into a directory in your
`load-path` and (optionally) byte-compile it.  To automatically
handle files ending in '.yml', add something like:

   (require 'yaml-path)

to your ~/.emacs (or ~/.emacs.d/init.el).

If you've installed yaml-mode, and would like to have C-c C-p show you the path
when you're in yaml-mode, add this to your initialization file.

   (add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook
    '(lambda ()
       (define-key yaml-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-p") 'yaml-path/path)))


### Known Bugs


   Should use line-number-at-pos and goto-line
   instead of using point everywhere.

   Should be faster, so that motion functions like next-line, previous-line
   could be advised and the path would be continuously displayed.

### Function Documentation


#### `(yaml-path/empty-line-p)`

Is the current line empty?

#### `(yaml-path/comment-line-p)`

Is the current line a comment?

#### `(yaml-path/yaml-line-p)`

Is the current line a valid YAML line?

#### `(yaml-path/safe-to-enable-p)`

Safe to enable dynamic path update for current file?

#### `(yaml-path/enable-path-in-eldoc-maybe &optional FORCE ENABLE-MODE)`

Display the path to the current YAML element using eldoc and optionally ‘ENABLE-MODE’.

#### `(yaml-path/enable-path-in-modeline-maybe &optional FORCE ENABLE-MODE)`
